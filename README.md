# Final-Project - COVID-19 ANALYSIS

The final project incorporated key skills learnt in the  8 week training.

Achievement: I was able to work in an agile environment to analyse COVID-19 data. Within the team, 4 main aims were answered: How is the pandemic progressing around the world? How does this pandemic stack up to those of the past? What is the effect of varying healthcare expenditure on spread and mortality? What is the impact of the UK preventative measures? I was working in a self-organised group analysing dataset regarding healthcare and was able to carry out data-cleaning. I then produced data visualisation on tableau which showed meaningful conclusions. I found out that an increase in healthcare expenditure was a factor in reducing the number of deaths in the pandemic. However the data suggests that governmentâ€™s response and strategy (e.g. testing) during pandemics have the highest impact on the number of cases.
